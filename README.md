Comments:
In the zip folder you have all the images you need
The text is not important at all, put “lorem ipsum” or dummy text
Styling is important but functionality is much more.
The “Edit” logic is optional flow.

Good to have but not mandatory:
Use styled components instead of traditional CSS.
Use redux toolkit instead of the old redux 
Instead of making the data hard coded make a separate file a JSON with the relevant data as a mock and mock a BE call to receive the data.
Feel free to contact me on any question
Good luck!
